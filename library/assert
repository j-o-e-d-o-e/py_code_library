assert

debugging/testing

- makes sure that a specific condition holds true
- if not, execution halts and AssertionError is raised

EXAMPLE
(1)
door = "open"
assert door == "open"  # first 'assert' goes fine
door = "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can\'t do that."
assert door == "open"  # raises assertion error

(2)
a = []  # to make sure a list isn't empty
assert not (len(a)) == 0, "list is empty"  # AssertionError: list is empty
