help()

IDLE

If no argument is given, the interactive help system starts on the interpreter console.

If the argument is a string, then the string is looked up as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic, and a help page is printed on the console.

EXAMPLE
help(list) #prompts elaborate list about all methods of the class 'list'

help(str.join) #prompts infos only about the 'join'-method
