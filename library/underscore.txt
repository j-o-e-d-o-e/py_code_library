_underscore_



'Underscores' are used to indicate "throwaway"-variables, which are of no further interest. This is merely a convention, the 'underscore' still gets a value assigned.

EXAMPLES
a=(1,2,3,4)
b,_,_,c = a
b,c
#prompts: (1, 4)

a = ((1,"a"),(2,"b"),(3,"c"))
for _, i in a:
	print (i)
#prints:
a
b
c
