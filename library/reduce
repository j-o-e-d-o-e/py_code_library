reduce()

advanced funtion

- applies a function to all the list elements and reduces the list to a single value
- process
  - At first step, first two elements of sequence are picked and the result is obtained
  - Next step is to apply the same function to the previously attained result and the number just succeeding the second element and the result is again stored
  - This process continues till no more elements are left in the container
  - The final returned result is returned

EXAMPLE
import functools

list = [1,3,5,6,2]
print("Sum:", functools.reduce(lambda a,b: a+b, list))
print("Max:", functools.reduce(lambda a,b: a if a > b else b, list))
