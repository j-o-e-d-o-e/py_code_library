split()

from strings to lists

S.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)

Returns a list of the words in S, using sep as the delimiter string which gets cut out.

If sep is not specified or None, any whitespace string is a separator and empty strings are
removed from the result.

EXAMPLE
"My name is simon".split("m") #returns: ['My na', 'e is si', 'on']

script = """hello, here i am
i am writing you this little text

because i want to have a text
with triple quotes as an example."""

print(script.split("\n")) #removes all "\n"
#['hello, here i am', 'i am writing you this little text', '', 'because i want to have a text', 'with triple quotes as an example.']
