strings



- strings are immutable. In order to change their value, save the changes in a new variable.
- split() splits a string in pieces and returns a list
- str.upper() returns string str in upper case

EXAMPLE
name = "Zophie a cat"
print (name)
newName = name[0:7] + 'the' + name[8:12]
print (newName)

pline = line.replace("\n", "") #remove newlines by replacing with ""
print (pline)

a = "adam and eve"
a.split()
#prompts: ['adam', 'and', 'eve']
