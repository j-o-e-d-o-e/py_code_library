pass



- The 'pass'-statement is a null operation. Nothing happens when it executes.
- Useful in places where code has not been written yet
- Especially useful for superclasses which pass on their attributes to their subclasses

EXAMPLE
for char in "abc:
	if char == "a":
		pass
		continue
	print(char, end="")
#prints: ac
