assertions

debugging

- 'assert'-statements make sure that a specific condition holds true
- If not, execution halts and AssertionError is raised

EXAMPLE
door = "open"
assert door == "open" #first 'assert' goes fine
door = "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can\'t do that."
assert door == "open"
#raises assertion error

#to make sure a list isn't empty:
a = []
assert not(len(a)) == 0, "list is empty"
#prompts: (...) AssertionError: list is empty
