copy

for lists/dicts, from copy

copy.copy makes a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference. deepcopy() copies inner lists as well.

EXAMPLE
"""to make changes to a list without modifying the original list"""
import copy
spam = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
cheese = copy.copy(spam)
cheese[1] = 42
spam # prints ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
cheese # prints ['a', 42, 'c', 'd', 'e']
